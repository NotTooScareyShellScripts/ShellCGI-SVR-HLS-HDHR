	<h1>DEVTESTING THIS ONLY WORKS IF TUNER IS NOT BUSY and createthumbnails.cgi can start Generally on a new install this isnt a issue. But devices
		could be sharing and this would block the install until the tuner becomes avail. Need to report back the error here. This page will
		keep trying based on the CONTENT refresh value. Apache would likely timeout after x  minutes, but something needs to catch this earlier.</h1>
		I may omit this step due to its dependence on tuner availabilty that could cause a loop, and just run the preview scan at install time once
		to populate. This is all about the first run to populate thumbmails and html so the pages exist prior to using using menu.
		The mp4 method of using template can stay because it will doesnt depend on tuner availability and running it early would just make a blank page.
		
		<h1>: Starting initial thumbnail creation. Please wait.</h1>
	<h2><i>This could be done in a few seconds or a few minutes, depending on how many channels you have available.</i></h2>
